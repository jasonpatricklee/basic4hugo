Dummy text refers to the bits of content that are used to fill a website mock-up. This text helps web designers better envision how the website will look as a finished product.

It is important to understand that dummy text has no meaning whatsoever. Its sole purpose is to fill out blank spaces with “word-like” content, without making any copyright infringements.

Dummy text is also known as filler text or placeholder text, and it has been used for a long time in the various fields of online publishing.
